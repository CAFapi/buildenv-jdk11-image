 | This is the configuration file for Maven. It can be specified at two levels:
 |
 |  1. User Level. This settings.xml file provides configuration for a single user,
 |                 and is normally provided in ${user.home}/.m2/settings.xml.
 |
 |                 NOTE: This location can be overridden with the CLI option:
 |
 |                 -s /path/to/user/settings.xml
 |
 |  2. Global Level. This settings.xml file provides configuration for all Maven
 |                 users on a machine (assuming they're all using the same Maven
 |                 installation). It's normally provided in
 |                 ${maven.home}/conf/settings.xml.
 |
 |                 NOTE: This location can be overridden with the CLI option:
 |
 |                 -gs /path/to/global/settings.xml
 |
 | The sections in this sample file are intended to give you a running start at
 | getting the most out of your Maven installation. Where appropriate, the default
 | values (values used when the setting is not specified) are provided.

     | it to several places.
     |
     | That repository definition will have a unique id, so we can create a mirror reference for that
     | repository, to be used as an alternate download site. The mirror site will be the preferred
     | server for that repository.

    <!-- profiles
     | This is a list of profiles which can be activated in a variety of ways, and which can modify
     | the build process. Profiles provided in the settings.xml are intended to provide local machine-
     | specific paths and repository locations which allow the build to work in the local environment.
     |
     | For example, if you have an integration testing plugin - like cactus - that needs to know where
     | your Tomcat instance is installed, you can provide a variable here such that the variable is
     | dereferenced during the build process to configure the cactus plugin.
     |
     | As noted above, profiles can be activated in a variety of ways. One way - the activeProfiles
     | section of this document (settings.xml) - will be discussed later. Another way essentially
     | relies on the detection of a system property, either matching a particular value for the property,
     | or merely testing its existence. Profiles can also be activated by JDK version prefix, where a
     | value of '1.4' might activate a profile when the build is executed on a JDK version of '1.4.2_07'.
     | Finally, the list of active profiles can be specified directly from the command line.
     |
     | NOTE: For profiles defined in the settings.xml, you are restricted to specifying only artifact
     |       repositories, plugin repositories, and free-form properties to be used as configuration
     |       variables for plugins in the POM.
     |
     |-->
    <profiles>
        <!-- profile
         | Specifies a set of introductions to the build process, to be activated using one or more of the
         | mechanisms described above. For inheritance purposes, and to activate profiles via <activatedProfiles/>
         | or the command line, profiles have to have an ID that is unique.
         |
         | An encouraged best practice for profile identification is to use a consistent naming convention
         | for profiles, such as 'env-dev', 'env-test', 'env-production', 'user-jdcasey', 'user-brett', etc.
         | This will make it more intuitive to understand what the set of introduced profiles is attempting
         | to accomplish, particularly when you only have a list of profile id's for debug.
         |
         | This profile example uses the JDK version to trigger activation, and provides a JDK-specific repo.
        <profile>
          <id>jdk-1.4</id>

          <activation>
            <jdk>1.4</jdk>
          </activation>

          <repositories>
            <repository>

        </profile>
        -->

        <!--
         | Here is another profile, activated by the system property 'target-env' with a value of 'dev',
         | which provides a specific path to the Tomcat instance. To use this, your plugin configuration
         | might hypothetically look like:
         |
         | ...
         | <plugin>
         |   <groupId>org.myco.myplugins</groupId>

         | </plugin>
         | ...
         |

         |       anything, you could just leave off the <value/> inside the activation-property.
